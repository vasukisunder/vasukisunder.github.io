I found this artist's manifesto very inspiring this week. So much of it felt deeply relevant and understandable and true, and I think I wouldn't have felt the same way before coming to art school — being here is continuously molding my inner perspective on creativity, discipline, self-expression, work.

"Don't create and analyze at the same time, they're different processes" — I just learned this this semester with my MS2 project; I've been doing a lot of analysis and hoping the simultaneous creating would work itself out. 

"Pull everything out of your teacher / fellow students" — another one that rings true, there's such a massive difference between being a creative person on your own in the world, the only designer at a company, a freelance designer (or attempting to be), and then being in an environment surrounded by creatives. Just seeing my classmate's projects in every class and being exposed to so many modes of creativity is probably the most impactful part of being here. 

"It's lighter than you think" — glad to get confirmation that my constant internal crisis about being an artist is maybe just normal, and also so true.

Also the notes on going to everything, reading anything you can, watching movies carefully, saving everything... truly words to live by for me. 

"If you work it will lead to something, it's the people who do all of the work all the time who eventually catch on to things." — above all else, this is the one that hits the hardest. I never really consider myself a "hard worker," yet I still approach every project with the mindset of an overachiever and a perfectionist... honestly most of the time I view this negatively, because I should probably go to sleep instead of exploring ideas at 4am every day. Yet, I think following my heart with these endeavors DOES eventually lead to "catching on to things" as they say. As a result of various projects I went "all in" on since I got here, I feel like I'm slowly starting to see the payoff, like in internship offers, RA opportunities, and even a deep sense of personal achievement and excitement as I continue diving into new projects.
