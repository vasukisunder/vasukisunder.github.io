title: Finalizing the script, realizing more limitations

Continuing to work on my prototype this week, with good news and bad news.

Good news: Last week I identified that the story component was what mattered to me, and I moved away briefly (or so I thought) from the data viz part, and thought about how I could structure a story in my project. For last weeks prototype, I came up with the basic main points I wanted to hit, which took a ton of new research, and I used some Lorem Ipsum on a Figma prototype to kind of emulate my goal of a “scrollytelling” website.

This week, I was determined to translate that outline/draft into a real story, so I finally did that. Wow, that was very intensive in terms of research but I think I’m kind of happy with the story I’ve landed on. The hardest part was in figuring out what to include, like what’s actually important versus just filler material, what would people find interesting? When I’ve told people about this project, they seem to think a lot of what I found very interesting and new to be old news, so maybe this entire project was born out of me just being uninformed about something obvious, but it’s too late to dwell on that… 

I also finally came up with a title — “The cloud is a place on earth”. It’s meant to make you realize that there are real-world implications of the technology that we take for granted and treat as though it’s magical. Here is the basic outline and structure for the script I wrote:

Title: The cloud is a place on earth \
Sections: Intro, War, Surveillance, Corporations, Extraction, Algorithms, Conclusion

1. Introduction
   1. The cloud is not mysterious, weightless, new 
2. War
   1. Codebreaking and Turing
   2. ENIAC primary purpose
      1. Unseen women workers
   3. Manhattan Project's computational demands driving innovation
   4. Von Neumann's work on both nuclear weapons and early computers
3. Surveillance 
   1. Technologies developed to monitor Soviet threats were turned inward:
      1. SAGE air defense system's repurposing for domestic surveillance
      2. NSA's early computing projects for signals intelligence
      3. FBI's use of early databases to track civil rights activists
   2. Vietnam became a testing ground for computational warfare:
      1. Project IGLOO WHITE: automated battlefield
      2. Early drone development and remote sensing
      3. Pattern recognition algorithms for identifying "insurgent activity"
4. Corporations
   1. Transition of computing from public to private
      1. ARPANET's commercialization and privatization
      2. Shift from open protocols to proprietary systems
      3. Emergence of surveillance capitalism from military surveillance techniques
   2. Hidden costs / physical infrastructure of computing (connection to cloud)
      1. Toxic waste
      2. Electronic waste streams
5. Extraction
   1. Coltan mining - Blood Coltan
   2. Rare earth element extraction
   3. Water and energy demands of semiconductor chip manufacturing
6. Algorithms
   1. Military prediction systems evolved into commercial and governance tools
      1. From military logistics optimization to Amazon's delivery algorithms
      2. From enemy identification systems to facial recognition surveillance
      3. From battlefield coordination to gig worker management
   2. Military tech to addiction uses
      1. Military research on attention and vigilance
      2. Adaptation of these techniques for social media engagement
      3. Measurement and manipulation of emotional states
7. Conclusion
   1. Bringing back hope, understanding, and agency
   2. Tech wasn't designed for human flourishing
      1. War, surveillance, control, commercial 
   3. Understanding its history gives us power

When I read through the actual script, I personally feel like the story is very compelling and eye-opening. One thing that I do want to remember is how to leave the users with a sense of hope instead of doom at the end of it, but I’ll leave the details of the Conclusion for the end. 

Now for the bad news. I’m glad I took the step back to work on the story because now I feel like the project is about something worth telling and has the potential for impact. That being said, I’ve kind of just been hoping that I’ll “figure out” the technical implementation I’m dreaming of later, and after many many hours of struggling with the code this weekend, that is seeming very unlikely. 

It firstly took me an entire day and a half of focused effort just to figure out how to implement “scrollytelling” — with how ubiquitous this feature seems in data journalism, I would have assumed it was an easy add-in. Then it took another full day to understand just how to make the background image switch as I scrolled from each “scroll-step”. 

I had dreams of somehow incorporating interactive data visualizations that evolved with the scroll, but that seems like a distant impossibility at this point. Even just accomplishing the task of adding in unique images for each scroll-step is going to take at least a few days, if I’m lucky and don’t accidentally break something for the millionth time.
