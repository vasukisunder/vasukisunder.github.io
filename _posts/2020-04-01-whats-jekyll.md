Dreams, memories, nostalgia, joy, chaos, eternity — these themes are intrinsically tied to the human experience; in essence, they are what makes us human. As humans, we impart our very human values onto the world around us, and in today’s age, the world around us is dominated by technology. I want to explore the juxtaposition of these very human values with the tech we hold dear — computers that are theoretically cold, inorganic, and indifferent.

Computers lack life, but we as humans see life in everything. At least, that is my hypothesis going into this 5 in 5 project. The questions I want to explore:

In what ways do we bestow existential themes onto the digital world?
How do we blur the boundaries between technology and ourselves?

In the future, I would like to explore these themes in more specific and tangible directions, such as:

How can we design technology with a focus on the human experience?
What are the implications of our need to ascribe meaning into technology?
Do we redefine what it means to be human in our quest to find resonance with technology?
